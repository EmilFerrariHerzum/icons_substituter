# Icons Substituter
It's a small python script that scrapes the icons from a specific dashboard in order to update the images on the AWS bucket 
with new ones, chosen manually by the user.

## Contributing
It's really just the first python script I made concerning web scraping and interaction with AWS. Not looking for any
contributors.
